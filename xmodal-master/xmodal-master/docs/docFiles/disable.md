### 📝 isDisable

You can disable modal click events to preventing users to close the modal.
<br>
**🟢 isDisable is useful when you want to close modal based on some condition. ( like: checking if the input is correct or etc...)**

Example:
```javascript
params: {
	isDisable: true // prevent user click
}
```
 **⚠️ [hasTimer](docFiles/timer.md) will not work with isDisable**
