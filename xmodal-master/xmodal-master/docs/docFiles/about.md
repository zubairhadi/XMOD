## get rid of those ugly ðŸ’© predefined modals
xmodal will let you define custom components and show them as modal. **YOUR APP YOUR RULES!** - too simple and easy

</p>
This little library comes with customization tools that will make your life a little bit easier.


## Why you need xmodal?
Most of the time you just stuck with predefined modals that don't fit your web styles and overall design.

xmodal allows you to create custom modals.
You just need to create a component with your styles(textboxes etc...), and xmodal will treat that component as modal. This is how xmodal works.
